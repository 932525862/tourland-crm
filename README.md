## Deployment

This project is built using **TanStack Start** and is optimized for **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**.

### Vercel Deployment

Pushing to the `main` branch triggers an automatic deployment.
- **SSR**: No `vercel.json` rewrites are needed; the framework handles routing and server-side rendering natively.
- **Timezone**: The application uses `Asia/Tashkent` globally for consistency across all modules (Attendance, Tasks, Archive).
